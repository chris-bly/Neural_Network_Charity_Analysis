# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Objective
The objective of this challenge was to develop a neural network utilizing the TensorFlow library and machine learning in Jupyter Notebook to develop a binary classifier that could predict whether applicants for charitable funds would be successful in their endeavours upon funding. To accomplish this task, we have to:
- preprocess the data for optimal entry into a neural network model
- compile, train, and evaulate the model, and
- optimize the model based on initial output

Ultimately, the objective is to develop a model that is able to predice the outcome of a loan application to lead to a successful project with accuracy â‰¥75%.
 
## Results

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
- The variable ```IS_SUCCESSFUL``` was the target of the neural network model for this analysis.
- Features of the model included in the analysis included the categorical var
- The variable columns ```EIN``` and ```NAME``` were dropped from the dataframe as they did not provide data of analytic value.
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary/Conclusions


After preprocessing the data, it was clear that the 533 different cryptocurrencies that were available on the market could be best grouped into 4 distinct clusters. Further analysis can be done to investigate the difference between clusters to see if a particular category is optimal for investment, or if a diversified wallet will lead to the most secure investment.
